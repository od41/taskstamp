# taskstamp
Companion plugin for skills &amp; work attestation on-chain

### Notes

Asana API - https://developers.asana.com/docs/authentication
Programmatically view, and complete tasks
Cometh connect - account abstraction
zkScroll - deploy smart contract
Mask Network - private identity graph. for when users are generating their resumes later

***
Uma 
- use their natural language oracle to store proofs of task completion from asana to the user's account.

How it works: it uses a prover and challenger model (optimistic) where it assumes every proposal is correct unless a challenger successfully says it's false. The consequence is that a stake (which is required for proposing) will be slashed or lost.

the proposal has to be publicly verifiable. so it won't work for our usecase

*** 
sismo
- 

How it works: create data source with the Sismo factory UI...

Each time a project manager creates a project and tasks in the project, it forms a data source for that user.

After creating a data source in sismo factory, you can use the data source in sismo connect
